#1.查询工资最低的员工信息
SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE salary=(
SELECT MIN(salary) FROM employees);

#2.查询平均工资最低的部门信息
#通过排序分页子查询可查出最低工资，但部门编号理论上不一定唯一，不能直接使用
#①查询最低工资---此处可以用min函数及排序分页两种方法实现
SELECT MIN(s.ag)
FROM(SELECT AVG(salary) ag FROM employees GROUP BY department_id) s;

SELECT AVG(salary) ag FROM employees GROUP BY department_id 
ORDER BY ag ASC LIMIT 1;
#②查询平均工资等于最低工资的部门编号---此处结合①中2种结果都可以实现
SELECT department_id FROM employees GROUP BY department_id
HAVING AVG(salary)=(SELECT MIN(s.ag)
FROM(SELECT AVG(salary) ag FROM employees GROUP BY department_id) s);


#3.查询平均工资最高的部门信息和该部门的平均工资
SELECT d.*, (SELECT AVG(salary)   
                      FROM employees   
                      WHERE department_id = d.department_id) "最高平均工资"  
FROM departments d   
WHERE d.department_id IN (   
       SELECT department_id FROM employees   
       GROUP BY department_id 
       HAVING AVG(salary) =(   
               SELECT AVG(salary) ag FROM employees   
               GROUP BY department_id
               ORDER BY ag DESC
               LIMIT 1)   
        );

SELECT d.*
FROM departments d
JOIN (
	SELECT AVG(salary) avgs,department_id
	FROM employees
	GROUP BY department_id
)ad
ON d.`department_id`=ad.department_id
AND d.`department_id` IN(
	SELECT department_id
	FROM employees
	GROUP BY department_id
	HAVING AVG(salary)=(
		SELECT AVG(salary) ag
		FROM employees
		GROUP BY department_id
		ORDER BY AVG(salary) DESC
		LIMIT 1
		)
);

#4.查询平均工资最高的job信息
#①查询job_id对应最高平均工资
SELECT AVG (salary) ag
FROM employees
GROUP BY job_id
ORDER BY ag DESC
LIMIT 1;

#②查询最高平均工资及对应的job_id
SELECT j.*
FROM jobs j
WHERE job_id IN(
	SELECT job_id
	FROM employees
	GROUP BY job_id
	HAVING AVG(salary)=(
		SELECT AVG(salary) ag
		FROM employees
		GROUP BY job_id
		ORDER BY AVG(salary) DESC
		LIMIT 1
		)
);

#③连接查询
SELECT j.*,MAX(aj.avgs)
FROM jobs j
JOIN (
	SELECT AVG(salary) avgs,job_id
	FROM employees
	GROUP BY job_id
)aj
ON j.`job_id`=aj.job_id
AND j.`job_id`IN(
	SELECT job_id
	FROM employees
	GROUP BY job_id
	HAVING AVG(salary)=(
		SELECT AVG(salary) ag
		FROM employees
		GROUP BY job_id
		ORDER BY AVG(salary) DESC
		LIMIT 1
		)
);

#5.查询平均工资高于公司平均工资的部门有哪些
SELECT department_id
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id
HAVING AVG(salary)>(
	SELECT AVG(salary) 
	FROM employees
);

#6.查询出工资中所有manager的详细信息
SELECT *
FROM employees 
WHERE employee_id IN (
	SELECT DISTINCT manager_id
	FROM employees
);

#7.各个部门中，最高工资中最低的那个部门的最低工资是多少
SELECT MIN(salary),department_id
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id
HAVING MAX(salary) =(
	SELECT MAX(salary) 
	FROM employees
	GROUP BY department_id
	ORDER BY MAX(salary) ASC
	LIMIT 1
);

#8.查询平均工资最高的部门的manager的详细信息
SELECT *
FROM employees
GROUP BY manager_id
HAVING `department_id` IN(
	SELECT department_id
	FROM employees
	GROUP BY department_id
	HAVING AVG(salary)=(
		SELECT AVG(salary) ag
		FROM employees
		GROUP BY department_id
		ORDER BY AVG(salary) DESC
		LIMIT 1
		)
);
